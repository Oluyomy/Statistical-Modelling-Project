# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python
Statistical modelling with python
## Project/Goals
1.To extracte data for bike stations in Boston USA from public APIs  sources.(Citybikes, Yelp and Foursquare).
2.Cleaning and transforming the data.
3.Developing insights into the trends and estimating relationships between POI which are turned into independent and dependent variables .
4.Building a  Linear Regression model.

## Process
.API request for data collection(publicly available dataset).
.Merging.
.EDA process for Visualization.
    Exploration and preliminary analysis of the dataset.
    Summary statistics and exploring visualization of the data.
    Uncover anomalies, patterns and relationship between variables.
    Used for data cleaning.
.Regression modelling.

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
.Data acquisition was time consuming .
. APIs have limited information and outputs.
.Joining the dataframes were time consuming as there were limited and unrelated columns to work with.
.Inconsistent values in columns.

## Future Goals
If I have more time, I will explore other APIs asides these 3, gain more insights on various trends, distributions and relationships between variables.
